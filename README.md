# static-strata

> Ode to a static type system and tooling for TypeScript.

This project is inspired by Kent C. Dodd's seminal ["Write Tests. Not too many. Mostly integration."](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests) article in which he emphasizes the benefits of using a static type system and tooling.

While a static type system and tooling will not substitute a solid suite of unit, integration and end-to-end tests, they can alleviate the burden of writing superfluous runtime checks.
